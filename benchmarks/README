To run the SYBOPT tests, you need to install the hermit-syb plugin, with
modified base libraries that expose the right unfoldings, if you haven't
already. See ../README

You also need to cabal install parseargs and parallel.

Now to actually run the benchmarks:

make
make run

==============================================================================

To change which tests are run, edit the list 'tests' at the bottom of 'Tests.hs'
To disable SYBOPT tests, add following to 'tests' list comprehension:
    , null (ghcFlags t)

make         : After changing Main.hs or Tests.hs
make run     : To run the tests once
make profile : To profile the tests (see time spent in traversal)
               NB: you need all libraries built with profiling, only do this for Hand
make space   : Profiles the space usage of GHC while compiling the tests (to make sure
               the space leak patch to GHC was successful). Not necessary.
make final   : To run the tests 10 times, giving average and std_dev

What we call MapTree in the paper is in Map/. What we call MapLogic is in Update/.
Note that the Update/Tree test has been commented out in Tests.hs for this reason.
