Due to recent changes in the HERMIT API, this code currently breaks with
a Core Lint error on some target programs.  We are working to update the
code to work with the latest HERMIT.  In the meantime, the transformation
does work on Sum.hs and some of the benchmarks.

You need HERMIT built on GHC HEAD to run these. Follow the directions here:

https://github.com/ku-fpg/hermit/wiki/GHC-HEAD

Once that is done:

cd hermit-syb
cabal install
cd ..

hermit Sum.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapInt
- or -
hermit Sum.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapIntM
- or -
hermit Sum.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapInt mapIntM

Note about submodules
=====================

A version of HERMIT that works with this plugin is pegged as
a submodule, in case the most recent HERMIT does not work.
When you first clone this repository, you need to:

git submodule init
git submodule update

to pull down the contents of the submodules.

Whenever you pull new changes that include new submodule hashes, you must:

git submodule update
