You need GHC >= 7.8, with specially compiled base/ghc-prim/syb libraries,
in order to run the optimization. Instructions:

https://github.com/ku-fpg/hermit/wiki/GHC-HEAD

Once that is done:

cd hermit-syb
cabal install
cd ..

cabal install haskell-src (for Sum.hs only)

hermit Sum.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapInt
- or -
hermit Sum.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapIntM
- or -
hermit Sum.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapInt mapIntM

Note about submodules
=====================

A version of HERMIT that works with this plugin is pegged as
a submodule, in case the most recent HERMIT does not work.
When you first clone this repository, you need to:

git submodule init
git submodule update

to pull down the contents of the submodules.

Whenever you pull new changes that include new submodule hashes, you must:

git submodule update
